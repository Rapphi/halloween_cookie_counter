# Cookie Clicker Project
## Team :
* Project Manager : Raphaël Nomberg
* Back-End : Etienne Huang
* Front-End : Sofian Mattheus
## The Project Philosophy : "Make it Work then Make it Fast then Make it Beautiful...and Accessible!" (S. Dante)
## Phases :
* Day 1 : implementation of features 1 to 10
* Day 2 : implementation of features 11 and 12
* Day 3 : layout and styling of left and right blocks; SEO and speed optimization -> much time spent on finding a lightweight gif to ensure a good performance score while having a funny background
* Day 4 : finish layout and styling; check : W3C, indentation, Lighthouse; check functionality and ergonomy of the game (works according to instructions and is easily comprehensible).
## Issues :
* Github and Gitbash knowledge must be strengthened and applied in real-world assignments
* argument between team members due to a misunderstanding; settled by discussion
* Back-end developer was on sick leave on Day 3 and Day 4. He had already done most of the features but we couldn't fine tune like we wanted to.
## Pending : 
* responsive feature yet to be done
